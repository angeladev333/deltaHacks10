## Inspiration 🌟

At the heart of Symphonic lies a vision – a world where non-profits can share their stories with powerful, emotion-evoking music, but without the high costs and legal hurdles. Our journey began with an insight into the challenges faced by non-profits in making their voices heard. The cost of quality music production often put it out of reach for many. Symphonic emerged from this need, driven by the belief that every story deserves to be told with the emotional depth it warrants. Leveraging AI/ML technology, Symphonic crafts custom music that not only complements but enhances the narrative of each video. It's our way of empowering these organizations to tell their stories, to reach hearts and minds in a way that truly resonates. 🎵❤️


## What it does 🚀

Symphonic is not just a tool; it's a revolution in video content creation. By harnessing advanced AI/ML algorithms, Symphonic can intuitively generate music that aligns perfectly with the emotional flow and pace of a video. Each frame is thoughtfully enhanced with a musical composition that echoes its sentiment, transforming the viewing experience into something deeply immersive. This technology is especially invaluable for non-profits, who can now create content with the emotional impact of high-budget productions, but within their means. Symphonic is here to ensure that impactful stories are not just told, but are felt. 🎶
